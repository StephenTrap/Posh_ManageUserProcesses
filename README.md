Posh_ManageUserProcesses
========================

This is a quick way to kill a process for a user on a remote machine.

I use it to end a hanging process on a Server 2012 Remote Desktop Services user session since session shadowing is not available (pre R2 release). Since I usually have PowerShell open anyway, this is faster than session shadowing for this kind of task.
